# BIOENG 1005/2005: RF Medical Devices Computer Project 2
Paul Kullmann & Adam Almoukamal

## Instructions for Running:
**Part 1:**  
For the 1D FDTD simulations in Part 1, download CP2_RF_1005_2025.m from the main branch and run the script.  

Four figures are created showing the electric field at indices 480, 501, 560, and 620 respectively. Each of the three tissue conditions is plotted for the time window t=22.5ns to t=62.5ns.
